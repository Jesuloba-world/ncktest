# NCK Technologies Test

This is a test given to me by NCK.
I was provided with a PDF file to translate into a website.
I gave the PDF to my designer friend who helped me convert to figma which I can easily understand and implement.
I started working on it, I added a lot of logic to the Card and Form Section using React-hook-form.
The rest of the Page is Static.

Have Fun.
